# Low-Level Playground

All C programs can be compiled using the simple `makefile` provided. Memory efficiency and leak detection have been verified using **Valgrind**.

My machine has a x86_64 architecture, for this reason ARMv7 programs have been cross-compiled with **arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc**, **qemu** and debugged with **gdb**.
